Goal:
	
To replace another object and control access to it.
=======================================================================================================
What is used for:

To provide control access to a specific object.
=======================================================================================================
Example of use:

- when there is a need to refer to an object in a manner different from the usual pointer;
    * remote replacement - local representative instead of the object in another
                                address space.

    * virtual substitution - the creation of "heavy objects" if necessary.

    * protected substitution - control access to the specified object

    * "smart" link - replacement of the usual pointer
                                (counting the number of links, setting the lock, etc.)
